# What's Inside You're Tire?
People usually think that tires are made of rubber. This is understandable, because rubber is all that you can see, but it's a serious oversimplification.

A tire is actually made up of three parts:

1. The beads are two hoops of strong steel cable (or, sometimes Kevlar ®.)

2. The cords, cloth forming the body of the tire, woven between the two beads. Most modern tires use nylon cords.

3. The rubber, which covers all the other parts. The rubber on the part that contacts the road is thicker, and is called the tread.

A bicycle tire is not airtight by itself, so it uses an inner tube, which is basically a doughnut-shaped rubber balloon. The inner tube has a valve to allow you to blow it up. (Tubeless tires are beginning to appear on bicycles, but are uncommon. They require the rim to be airtight, adding complications -- especially on a spoked wheel).

## What Is Inside Your Tire?
There are two types of valves in common use for bicycle tires:

**Schrader** valves are the same as the valves used on automobile tires. They are common on less-expensive bicycles, particularly those with wide rims and tires. Schrader valves are also sometimes called "American" or "automotive" valves.
Schrader valves have a removable valve core, which may be unscrewed with a special wrench that is often found on better valve caps. They have a spring-loaded valve mechanism. There is a small pin in the center of the valve opening which must be pushed in to put air in (or to let air out.) Before the introduction of the Zéfal HP pump in the 1970's, there was no portable pump that would do a decent job of inflating high-pressure tires with Schrader valves, which led to the popularity of:

**Presta** or "French" valves. These are smaller in diameter than Schraders. This makes them a bit lighter, and allows a smaller hole to be drilled in the rim (desirable for very narrow rims). Presta valves are used on most high-performance bicycles, and all tubulars. Presta-valve inner tubes come with valve stems of different lengths -- longer ones, for deep-section æro rims.
Presta valves don't use a spring, but they have a captive knurled nut to hold the core tight. Before you can pump up a Presta tube, you must loosen this knurled nut. It is also a good idea to tap the end of the pin, to break the seal loose, because they are sometimes sticky. After inflating the tube, you should re-tighten the valve nut to keep air from escaping.
Each type of valve requires a different type of pump fitting, but you can get an inexpensive adaptor to let you use a Schrader pump on a Presta valve.
Presta tubes may be used in rims that are drilled for Schrader valves, though it is advisable to use a rubber grommet in the valve hole. A Schrader valve won't fit through the valve hole on a rim drilled for Prestas. Presta-drilled rims (except the narrowest ones) may be drilled or reamed to accommodate Schrader valves.

## Rim Tape
The interior surface of the rim sometimes has burrs which can damage inner tubes, and the ends of the spokes may also cause punctures. For this reason, a rim tape is needed to protect the inside of the inner tube. If a rim has recessed spoke holes, the rim tape must withstand the air pressure in the tire. If the edges of the spoke holes are sharp, the tape also must resist being cut by them.

Some rim tapes are simple strips of rubber, similar to the rubber used to make the inner tube. These are adequate for use in wider rims without recessed spoke holes. Better rim tapes are of adhesive cloth or plastic. The rim tape must be just wide enough to fit the bottom of the rim. Too narrow, and it doesn't cover what it needs to. Too wide, and it interferes with the tire.

# Types of Flats
A tire goes flat because there is a hole in the inner tube. There may or may not be anything wrong with the tire itself.

Flat tires can be divided into four groups:

1. **Slow Leaks** take long enough to go flat that the bicycle may actually be ridden, but the tire will need to be pumped up more often than it should. It is normal for a tube to lose air over a period of weeks. If you put your bike away for the winter and come back in the spring, the tires will likely be soft or flat, but this doesn't necessarily mean that there is anything wrong with them: you may just need to pump them up.
If you use high-pressure tires, you should check the pressure at least once per week.
Slow leaks that take more than an hour or so to go down can often only be repaired by replacing the inner tube, since it may be impossible to find the hole.

2. **Punctures** are caused by running over sharp things which poke a hole through the tire and into the tube. Punctures may be caused by glass slivers, thorns, nails, bits of wire or other small, sharp objects.
The typical puncture puts a small hole in the tire, which doesn't matter. Patching or replacing the inner tube is the fix for punctures...but don't forget to remove the pointy thing from the tire before you put it back on!

3. **Pinch Cuts** result from hitting stones, curbs, or sharp edges of holes in the road surface. When the tire hits a sharp edge hard enough, it compresses so that it bottoms out. The inner tube can get pinched between the rock and the rim. Pinch cuts usually put two small holes in the tube. This type of damage is sometimes called a "snake bite" because the two holes look like the wound made by the fangs of a snake.
Pinch cuts sometimes ruin tires as well as tubes, but usually the tire will not be damaged.

  The impact that causes a pinch cut can also make a dent or "blip" in your rim.

4. **Blowouts** are sudden losses of air, usually accompanied by a loud BANG! Since the inner tube is just a rubber balloon, if you pump it up outside of a tire, it will stretch bigger and bigger the more air you put into it, until it pops. The inner tube will not take much pressure by itself, it needs to be held inside of a tire to get up to full pressure. If the tire doesn't hold the tube in all around, the tube will pop.

# 1. Wheel Removal
**Warning: dirty work.** Tires pick up dust and dirt. Especially in winter, rim brakes scrape black particles off wet aluminum rims. For an on-road repair, it is not a bad idea to carry a pair of light garden gloves in your toolkit. Black tights, shorts or trousers also are advisable.

It is possible to repair a flat by patching the inner tube without removing the wheel from the bicycle, and that may be preferable if the hub has a brake arm or internal-hub gear. (The hardest part, if you leave the wheel on, is slipping the uninflated tube past the shoes of a rim brake, if you are unable to loosen the brake.) Usually it is easier if you do take the wheel off. If you are going to replace the inner tube, you must take the wheel off. Here's how:

+ *Optional step:* Release the brake if your bike has handbrakes. If the tire is flat, it will slip out between the brake shoes, and if you replace it uninflated, it will slip back in. But then you will have to inflate it twice: once to test and once to ride.
  Good-quality "road" bikes usually have caliper brakes with a special "quick-release" mechanism to let the brake shoes open up wide enough to fit the tire through. You don't actually need this feature to remove a flat tire, but it is helpful. There will be a button on the brake handle, or a lever on the caliper (or cable hanger) to release the brake a bit.

  Bicycles with cantilever brakes, such as most mountain, hybrid, and touring bicycles, usually don't have quick releases on the brakes, so you may have to completely disable the brake by unhooking the transverse cable from one of the arms.

  Many brake levers for flat handlebars have a slotted adjusting barrel. Unless it is set at its loosest position already, you may be able to pull on the cable housing to release pressure on the adjusting barrel, turn the adjusting barrel to loosen it all the way, align the slots, and rotate the cable out through them.

  In the worst case, you may have to remove, replace and reajust a brake shoe, and that is usually more trouble than inflating the tire a second time!

+ **Nutted or "bolt-on" axles** use nuts to hold the wheel to the frame. They are used on most bicycles with internal-gear hubs or a single speed, and on older or less-expensive derailer-geared bicycles. To remove the wheel, you will need to loosen the nuts on each end of the axle. It is usually not necessary actually to remove the nuts, just loosen them and leave them on the axle. (Less work and less risk of losing the nuts/washers.)
  You will need a wrench for this. Most rear axles use the 15 mm size, fronts may use 1/2", 14 mm, or 15 mm. If you don't have the correct size wrench, you can use an adjustable wrench. Turn the nuts counter-clockwise to loosen them.

  *Do not try to do this job with pliers. Even if you do manage to loosen the nuts with pliers, you won't be able to get the nuts tight enough when you put the wheel back in. In addition, the pliers are likely to damage the nuts so that the correct wrench will no longer fit!*

  There should be a washer between each nut and the forkend, but one of the places that newer bikes cut corners is by leaving these washers off. If your bike has axle washers, use them. If the washers are serrated (have teeth) the teeth should press against the forkends.
+ **Quick-release axles** are hollow, and a thin rod called a "skewer" runs all the way through the axle. One end of the skewer is threaded, and has an acorn-shaped nut screwed on to it. The other end (usually placed on the bicycle's left side) uses a cam mechanism to secure the wheel. The cam is operated by a handle, which you can flip over to loosen the wheel. Pull the handle straight out away from the bike and flip it over. This will release the tension on the quick-release skewer, but you may need to loosen the mechanism a bit more before you can actually get the wheel out.
  To loosen the quick release skewer, once you have flipped the handle, hold the acorn nut with one hand, and turn the handle counterclockwise with the other until it is loose enough to let you remove the wheel. For an on-road repair, you stand in front of the bicycle or behind it, holding the wheel between your knees, or hook the saddle over a tree branch, or have a friend hold the bicycle upright. Try not to completely unscrew the acorn nut, because there are a couple of little springs that could get lost if you take it off.

  If you're not exactly clear how the quick release works, get somebody to explain it to you before you try removing your wheel. *Misuse of the quick release can cause very serious injury!*
+ **Front wheel** removal is fairly straightforward: Lift the bike by the handlebars, and the wheel will just fall out.
+ **Rear wheel** removal is a bit more complicated, but not usually too difficult, if you go about it in the correct sequence:
  + *Derailer Gears* look as if they would be the hardest, but are actually the easiest type of rear wheel to remove and re-install! The trick is to shift to the smallest (outermost) rear sprocket before loosening anything. This gets the derailer as far out of the way as possible. (It doesn't matter where the front derailer is.)
    After freeing the axle by loosening the quick release or axle nuts:

    1. Stand to the left of the rear wheel.
    2. Use your left hand to lift the bicycle by the seat tube.
    3. Use your right hand to pull the upper part of the rear derailer backward, so that the jockey (upper) pulley swings down and behind the cluster.
    4. If necessary, nudge the wheel forward with your right knee, and the wheel will fall out.
    5. Lay the bicycle down on its left side, so that there is no weight resting on the derailer...this is the most fragile part of the bike!
  + *Hub Brakes*, such as foot-operated "coaster" brakes, or hand-operated "drum" or "roller" brakes built into the rear hub will have a flat metal arm, called a "reaction arm" which will attach underneath the left chainstay. This must be disconnected from the chainstay before the wheel can be removed. In most cases, this means undoing the bolt which holds the end of the arm to the metal strap or braze-on on the chainstay.
    In the case of a hand-operated drum brake, you will also need to disconnect the brake cable, which can usually be done by unhooking it from the fittings it attaches to.
  + *Internal Gears*
    + Indicator Chains Many Sturmey-Archer and older Sachs internally-geared hubs (most commonly 3-speed) use a small chain called an "indicator spindle" which fits into the end of the axle. The gear cable attaches to this chain. The threaded fitting at the end of the cable must be unscrewed from the end of this little chain. This will require re-adjusting the gears when the wheel is re-installed. This procedure is explained in my Sturmey-Archer article.
    + *Bellcranks* Shimano 3-speed hubs (and some Sturmey-Archer 5-speeds) use a bellcrank to translate a pull on the gear cable into a push on a loose fitting pushrod that fits into the axle.
      The Shimano 3-speed is adjusted in middle gear, so that the letter "N" is centered in the window of the bellcrank.
      Sturmey-Archer S-5 bellcranks should be adjusted so that the cable is taut when the wide-range position is selected with the left shift lever.
    + *Sachs Clickboxes* Sachs/SRAM 5- and 7-speed hubs, and newer SRAM 3-speeds, use a "Clickbox" which is held onto the axle by a thumbscrew. No adjustment is normally needed (or possible) to the Clickbox. Once the Clickbox is removed from the axle, take care that the pushrod(s) don't fall out and get lost.
    + *Shimano Nexus Hubs* require the cable to be unhooked from the control ring. This is explained on my Nexus Mechanics Page. With Nexus hubs, it is often easier to open up one side of the tire and patch the tube on the bike, because this type of hub is the most difficult to remove.

# 2. Tire Removal
While you have the tire off the rim, examine the inside of it carefully. Thorns and glass slivers can hide, and may be difficult to remove. I find that pushing them back out through the tread, using a sharp instrument, is often helpful.
In addition to looking for sharp pointy things poking through, look also for broken cords or cuts in the fabric of the tire. If you find such cuts that run more than a millimeter or two, you should replace the tire when possible.

# 3. Tire Repair
If you're on the road and have a tire with a bad cut that could allow the tube to bulge through, you can make a temporary repair by installing a "boot" on the inside of the tire. This can be made of any flexible but non-stretchy material. The ideal thing is a piece cut from an old tire, because this will have the correct curved shape to begin with. I usually like to carry a strip 2-3 inches (50-75 mm) long, cut from an old tubular tire or a high-pressure road clincher. Mountain bikers sometimes use dollar bills folded over, or Mylar food wrappers.
One thing that is often tried, but doesn't work too well, is the rubber patches made for inner tubes...they are too stretchy.

A boot doesn't need to be glued in place: it will stay put just from the pressure of the inner tube against the tire.

Even the best of boots should only be considered a temporary repair. The tire will be less reliable, and you will feel a bump every time the tire goes around.

## Patching
Inner-tube patching is a very old, well established technology, and is quite reliable if done properly:
1. Select a patch appropriate to the size of the hole(s).

2. Use the sandpaper provided in the patch kit to buff the surface of the tube for an area a bit larger than the patch. If you don't have sandpaper, you can sand the affected area of the inner tube on the pavement. You need to buff the tube so that it is no longer shiny. If there is a molding line running along the area where the patch is to be applied, you must sand it down completely, or it will provide an air channel. Jobst Brandt suggests carrying a Bic razor blade in your patch kit to slice off mold lines. [I tried this and cut a hole in the tube -- back to sandpaper. John Allen]
  Avoid touching the buffed area with your fingers.

3. Apply a dab of rubber cement, then spread it into a thin coat, using your cleanest finger.
  Work quickly. You want a thin, smooth coat of cement; if you keep fiddling with it as it begins to dry, you'll risk making it lumpy. The thinner the cement, the faster it will dry.

4. Allow the cement to dry completely.

5. Make sure the cement has dried completely! You can check by tapping it with a knuckle.

6. Peel the foil from the patch and press the patch onto the tube firmly.

7. Squeeze the patch tightly onto the tube. You're done!

If you follow this procedure, and use good materials, your patched tube should be basically as good as new.
Patch failure generally results from one of two errors:
+ Not buffing the tube sufficiently, or:
+
