# Pedals, cranks and bottom brackets

##Pedals 

Replacing a set of pedals on your bike may seem simple enough, but here’s a few tips that will help you prevent damage and make sure they stay on tight for those long rides. I recommend using a proper 15mm pedal wrench for this job, as they have a long handle and are designed to fit properly in the small axle slots.
When removing your pedals, the first step is to make sure you have both wheels firmly on the ground. This will give you better support for the leverage that is required to loosen your very tight pedal threads.

###Right Pedal Removal

Loosen the right side pedal by turning counter-clockwise just like any traditional threaded nut. Notice how I have positioned the crank arm and pedal tool so that I can push down with more force.

###Left Pedal Removal

It is very important to remember that the left pedal has a reverse thread, which keeps the pedal from unscrewing while you ride. To loosen the left side you will have to turn the wrench clockwise.

###Pedal Installation

Before installing the new pedals, apply a thin coat of waterproof grease to the threads. This helps tighten your pedals and keep the treads from seizing, so that they can be removed in the future.
Tighten the right pedal by turning the wrench clockwise, and tighten the left pedal by turning counter-clockwise.


## Replacing cotterless crank arms


Tools Required

To remove the bolt, you’ll need either an 8mm allen key or 14mm socket wrench. To remove the crank arms, you’ll need a crank puller, a 16mm open-end wrench, and an adjustable wrench. If possible, a torque wrench should also be used for tightening.

###Crank Arm Removal

In order to safely remove the right side, you’ll have to shift the front derailleur onto the smallest chainring, and then carefully remove the chain and rest it on the bottom bracket, so that it doesn’t interfere with the crank arm removal.
Using the crank arm for leverage, loosen and remove the tightening bolt with your allen key or 14mm socket wrench. Be careful not to skin your knuckles on the chainring teeth.
Before using the crank puller, make sure it is fully extended so that the internal driver does not extend past the external threads.
Note: If crank threads are damaged, there are a few solutions at Park Tools.
Carefully thread the external threads of the crank puller clockwise into the crank arm. Avoid cross-threading, which will damage the crank and prevent future removal.
Once the crank puller is fully threaded, place the adjustable wrench on the external flats and turn the internal driver clockwise until it stops. Turn the driver clockwise using a 16mm wrench, until the crank arm pulls free of the spindle. Repeat the same process to remove the left crank arm.

###Crank Arm Installation

Before re-installing the cranks wipe both the square spindle and the crank’s spindle fitting to make sure there is no dirt or grease on either surface.
Now slide the right crank’s spindle fitting onto the spindle. Before installing the bolts, grease under the head and along the threads of both bolts. Thread the bolt all the way into the spindle threads and torque the bolt to about 35 foot-pounds, or 420 inch-pounds.
Set the chain back on the chainring and repeat the same installation procedure on the left side, making sure the crank arm is pointing opposite the right side.


## Overhauling a bottom bracket

Today we’ll learn how to overhaul and re-grease an adjustable bottom bracket. To remove the cranks you’ll need a crank puller, a 17mm open end wrench and a large adjustable wrench. To overhaul the bottom bracket you’ll need a bottom bracket wrench or a pin spanner, a hooked lock ring wrench, and a 36mm wrench. For re-greasing the bearings you’ll need some cleaning solvent and waterproof grease, a rag, a toothbrush and a small container to clean the bearing cages.

###Disassemble

Begin by removing the cranks. Watch the cotterless crank removal tutorial for a more detailed procedure. Once the cranks are removed, loosen and remove the lock ring on the non-drive or left side of the bike by turning counter-clockwise. Once the lockring is removed you should be able to easily loosen and un-thread the bearing race using either a pin spanner or a bottom bracket wrench.
Now pull the spindle and both bearing cages out of the frame. It’s important to remember which way the spindle came out, as they are directional. The drive side usually has a longer distance from the bearing race to the end of the threads. Wipe off the bearing cages, drop them into the solvent, and let them soak while you use your rag to clean the spindle and both outer bearing races.
Tighten the drive-side bearing race by turning it counter-clockwise with your 36mm wrench. Unless you are replacing the bottom bracket, there is no need to remove it.

###Inspect

Shine a flashlight into your bottom bracket shell to inspect the bearing race for pitting and wear. Inspect your other bearing race and then carefully inspect the spindle. Most wear occurs on the spindle’s bearing races. If you see pitting here you should take it to your local bike shop for a replacement.

###Clean

Now clean both bearing cages with a toothbrush and solvent, and then set them aside to air-dry. These should also be replaced if they are worn or have bent cages.

###Grease

Apply a layer of grease on both bearing races and cages. A grease gun makes it easy to squirt grease inside the gaps between the bearings. Then place the bearing cages into both races. The rounded side of the cage should be facing down into the bearing race. Seal them in with another layer of grease.

###Reassemble

Now insert the spindle the same way you removed it. Wipe off any excess grease that comes out on the spindle. Grease the threads inside the bottom bracket shell, and then slide the outer race and bearing cage onto the spindle. Thread it on all the way clockwise but don’t tighten it. Again you’ll need to wipe off excess grease.

###Adjust

Thread on the lock ring finger-tight. Before adjusting the bottom bracket, first install the drive-side crank arm and tighten it as shown in the crank installation tutorial. This will help us make a proper adjustment. Now hold the inner race firmly with your wrench or spanner and tighten the lock ring. When properly adjusted the spindle should spin smoothly. If it doesn’t, you’ll have to loosen the lock ring, back off the inner race a little bit, and then tighten it again.
Check for play by placing the crank arm close the frame and pushing and pulling it against the frame. There should be no movement. If it feels loose, you’ll have to loosen the lock ring, tighten the inner race a little bit, and then tighten the lock ring again. When the adjustment is correct, install and tighten the left crank arm and you’re done!


##How to replace a cartridge bottom bracket



For this job you’ll need a splined bottom bracket tool and a 32mm headset wrench, or a large adjustable wrench.

###Components

A cartridge bottom bracket usually has two main components. The cartridge contains the sealed bearings and spindle, and is usually threaded into the right (or drive side) of your frame. The lockring supports the opposite end of the cartridge and is usually threaded into the left (or non-drive side) of your frame.

###Bottom Bracket Removal

Remove the drive side first, using the lockring tool and wrench. On most bikes, the drive side has a left-hand thread, so you’ll need to turn your wrench clockwise to loosen. Once the drive side is removed, the non-drive side should easily loosen and unthread by turning counter-clockwise.
Before installing the new bottom bracket, carefully clean the threads on the inside of your frame, and then apply a thin layer of waterproof grease to the threads on both sides of the frame.
You’ll notice that most bottom brackets have an ‘L’ and ‘R’ written on them to assist in installation.

###Bottom Bracket Installation

To install, first thread the new lockring part way into the left side of the frame by turning it clockwise. Don’t tighten the left-side yet.
Thread the cartridge all the way into the right side of the frame by turning it counter-clockwise. Tighten it with about 25-30 foot-pounds of pressure (300-360 inch-pounds) using a torque wrench. Torque specifications vary, so it’s a good idea to check the manufacturer’s website for their exact product specifications.
Now you can finish tightening the left side clockwise until it is nice and snug.
