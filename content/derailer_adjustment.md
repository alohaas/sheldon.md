Derailer Adjustment

How Derailers Work
---
Most modern bicycles use [derailer](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_da-o.html#derailer) (or [d√©railleur](http://sheldonbrown.com/derailer.html), if you prefer the French spelling) gearing systems. Gear shifting is accomplished by leading the chain from one [sprocket](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_sp-ss.html#sprocket) to another.

Derailers look complicated, but they are actually very simple, brute-force devices.

The [front derailer](http://sheldonbrown.com/derailer-adjustment.html#front) simply consists of a [cage](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ca-g.html#cage) made of sheet metal that can move back and forth from side to side. As it does so, it pushes the chain sideways until it can't run on the [chainwheel](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ch.html#chainwheel) it has been riding on, then the chain falls off and lands on the chainwheel closest to its new location.

The [rear derailer](http://sheldonbrown.com/derailer-adjustment.html#rear) looks more complicated, but the only additional complication is that the rear derailer also contains the arm with the spring-loaded pulleys, that takes up the slack as the chain goes to smaller sprockets.

Both derailers work by pushing the chain sideways, so that it runs at an angle onto the sprocket, instead of straight. When the angle becomes sharp enough, the chain can no longer mesh with the sprocket. It then falls off of the sprocket and lands on the next one in line.

When the chain is being shifted from a smaller sprocket to a larger one, it is slightly different. The chain is forced to rub against the side of the larger sprocket next to the one it is riding on. Eventually, it gets snagged on the sides of the teeth of the larger sprocket, and yanked up and away.

Newer sprockets usually have specially shaped teeth, and ramps on their sides to make this operation run more smoothly. This is the major reason that modern derailer gear systems work better than older ones. It has very little to do with the quality of the derailer.

##Before You Try To Adjust A Rear Derailer, Make Sure It Isn't Bent!

Before you try to adjust your rear derailer, you should really make sure it isn't bent. The rear derailer is the most fragile and exposed part of a bicycle, and they are always getting bonked.

When a rear derailer gets whacked, it bends inward, toward the spokes. In some cases, it will actually go into the spokes of the rear wheel while it is turning. This is very bad news when it happens. If you are lucky, the derailer breaks. If you are less lucky, it takes a few spokes with it, and can easily ruin your rear wheel. If you are truly unfortunate, the pull of the spokes on the derailer can tug it backwards so forcefully that the [dropout](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_dr-z.html#dropout) (the frame part that the rear axle and derailer attach to) will be bent very sharply backward, or even broken. In some cases, this can render a frame a total loss.

When the derailer gets biffed, it is not usually the derailer itself that bends, but rather the hanger, the tab of the frame dropout that the derailer attaches to. This is because the part of the derailer that usually gets bumped is the strongest part, the [parallelogram](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_p.html#parallelogram) linkage that moves the [cage](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ca-g.html#cage) back and forth. (Note; on many older or less expensive bicycles, the hanger is not part of the frame, but is a separate part, which comes with the derailer.) This "[adaptor claw](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_aa-l.html#adaptor)" is held on mainly by the rear axle nut, or the quick-release skewer. On many newer frames, it is a bolt-on part, so it can be replaced if bent.

You can roughly check alignment by eye, if you look at the derailer from the rear. The two pulleys should be lined up **exactly** underneath one another, so that the chain runs straight up from the [tension pulley](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ta-o.html#tensionpulley) to the [jockey pulley](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_i-k.html#jockeypulley), with no sideways slant. Compare the line of the pulleys with that of the sprockets above them.

Well-intentioned folks sometimes grab ahold of the derailer and try to pull it back outward to its proper position. Unfortunately, they usually wind up yanking on the derailer by its [pulley cage](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ca-g.html#cage), which is the weakest part. As a result, they fail to straighten the bent hanger, and, instead, bend the cage as well.

When a derailer hanger is bent, it is generally necessary to remove the derailer to straighten it. Bike shops have a special tool, a bar with a sliding gauge on it, that screws into the hole in the hanger in place of the derailer. This tool provides lots of leverage to straighten the hanger with, and has a gauge to judge when it is parallel to the rear wheel. A rough, on-road repair is sometimes possible by removing the derailer and bending the tab with an adjustable wrench.

Note, wide-range [Campagnolo](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ca-g.html#campagnolo) derailers have cages that are **not** intended to be vertical; the lower pulley is farther outboard than the jockey pulley.

The Four Rear Derailer Adjustments, In Order of Importance

##The limit-stop screws
The limit stops are two screws that set the limits of how far the derailer can move from left to right. They are usually located on the back of the parallelogram; sometimes they face outward to the bicycle's right. The ends of a screw bumps into an internal part of the parallelogram when the derailer has moved all the way in the direction controlled by that screw.

The limit screws are not intended to move the derailer; they tell it where to stop when it is moved by the [shifter](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_sa-o.html#shifter) control. Loosening a limit stop allows the derailer to be moved farther in a particular direction by the shifter. Tightening it restricts the motion of the derailer in that direction.

Normally, the limit stops need to be set when a new derailer is installed, and should not require any further attention. If they seem to need adjustment on a bicycle that used to work properly, it is usually an indication that the derailer is [bent](https://github.com/livhaas/sheldon.md/blob/master/content/derailer_adjustment.md#before-you-try-to-adjust-a-rear-derailer-make-sure-it-isnt-bent). Trying to correct a bent derailer with the adjusting screws is OK as a temporary field repair, but is not a correct long-term repair.

On newer derailers, the limit stop screws are labeled: "H" (high) and "L" (low). On some older derailers, there is no such label, because the working ends of the screws are visible. If you shift such a derailer into high gear, note which screw is bumping into an internal part of the derailer...that screw is the high-gear stop; the other is the low-gear stop.

These are not particularly fussy adjustments. Don't be afraid to give half a turn or a turn at a time. The only place where there's any danger is the rear derailer's low gear stop, which can allow the derailer to go into the spokes if it is set very loose. The other limit stop screw of the rear derailer (and the two on the front derailer) will cause overshifting if set too loose, but this is relatively harmless and easily corrected.

1. Low-gear limit stop

    The low gear limit stop (usually marked by the letter "L") stops the derailer from shifting past the largest sprocket and throwing the chain into the spokes. If it is too loose, the derailer can overshift into the spokes, with disastrous results. If it is too tight, it will be difficult or impossible to shift down to the largest rear sprocket.

2. High-gear limit stop

    The high gear limit stop (usually marked by the letter "H") stops the derailer from shifting past the smallest sprocket and wedging the chain between the smallest sprocket and the dropout. If it is too loose, it really doesn't make much difference on a bike with indexed shifting, because the cable will not let the derailer overshift past the smallest sprocket. If the screw is too tight, it will be difficult or impossible to shift up to the smallest rear sprocket.
    
    Difficulty in upshifting to the smallest rear sprocket is rarely caused by misadjustment of the high-gear limit screw. More often, it results from the derailer's being bent, or from excess friction in the cable.

3. Indexing adjustment
    
    The indexing adjustment is the most frequently needed derailer adjustment. The detents (click-stops) that provide indexing are in the shifters, and the index adjustment sets the length of the cable so that the derailer is in the correct place to correspond with each click stop.

    If a derailer is correctly adjusted when it is installed, this is the only adjustment that should have to be tweaked later on, to accommodate cable stretch, or when cables are replaced.

    The indexing adjustment is an adjusting barrel located at one end of a length of cable housing. Many rear derailers have more than one index adjuster. All indexed derailers have an adjuster where the final loop of cable housing ends at the derailer itself. Many bicycles also have another adjusting barrel located so that it can be adjusted while you are riding. On mountain-bike-type shifters, this will be located at the shifter itself, just where the cable exits. On road bikes with handlebar-mounted shifters, there will usually be an adjusting barrel at the cable stop where the upper length of housing ends on the upper end of the down tube.

    It doesn't matter which of these adjustments you use: use whichever is more convenient.

    Before you try adjusting the indexing, shift to the highest gear (smallest sprocket.) Make sure that the shifter is in the position that allows the cable to be as loose as it can get. (Exception: Shimano	Rapid Rise derailers work the opposite way, so you are shifting to the largest sprocket).

    Click the shifter to the first click after the fully loose position, then turn the pedals forward. The chain should shift to the second smallest sprocket. If it doesn't, it means the cable is too loose. Turn an adjusting barrel counter-clockwise to tighten the cable. Start with half a turn, then check again. It is very common for beginners to over-correct by turning the adjuster too far. Sometimes this will result in moving the indexing so far off that it sort-of works, except that the clicks are one notch off, so one of the extreme gears doesn't work properly, but the others appear to be OK. This is why it is important to check that the shift from the smallest to the second-smallest sprocket occurs in the right place on the shifter.

    Fine adjustments are accomplished according to the following principles (opposite for Shimano Rapid rise derailers):
    
    -  Shifting to larger sprockets is accomplished by tightening the cable; if such shifts are slow, the cable is not tight enough-- turn the barrel counterclockwise to tighten it
    - Shifting to smaller sprockets is accomplished by loosening the cable; if such shifts are too slow, the cable is not loose enough--turn the barrel clockwise to loosen it
    
    If the rear indexing works properly when using the large chainwheel but not on the small chainwheel, or vice-versa, this is often a sign that the rear derailer hanger is bent.

4. Angle adjustment ("B-tension")

	Modern derailers have two spring-loaded pivots. The lower pivot, sometimes called the "a pivot" winds the cage up to take up slack as you go to smaller sprockets. The upper "b pivot" adds additional slack take-up ability by pushing the derailer's parallelogram backwards.

	The tension of the two springs needs to be balanced for best shifting.

	Most derailers have an angle adjustment screw (Shimano calls it "B-tension adjustment"). This adjusts the tension of the upper ("b") spring of the parallelogram, and thus the height of the jockey pulley. The looser this screw is, the closer the jockey pulley will be to the cluster.

	The angle adjustment will need to be set according to the size of the largest rear sprocket. If you change to a cluster with a larger or smaller low-gear sprocket, you will need to re-adjust this setting. You will also need to adjust this if you change the length of your chain.

	If the angle adjuster is set too loose, the jockey pulley will bump into the largest sprocket when the bicycle is in the lowest gear (large rear, small front). This is the gear you should check the adjustment in. A larger low-gear sprocket may require a different rear derailer, for enough angle adjustment to clear the sprocket. In extreme cases, such as with a Shimano 36-tooth sprocket, a longer angle-adjustment screw may be needed -- some people even install the screw backwards.

	Since a derailer shift is caused by forcing the chain to run at an angle, the greater the angle, the sooner it will shift. The closer the jockey pulley is to the cluster, the sharper the angle will be for a given amount of sideways motion of the derailer. Thus, the looser the angle adjuster screw is, the better the shifting will be.	 
	**Campagnolo Rear Derailers**
	2001 and later Campagnolo rear derailers don't use a "b tension" adjustment. Instead, they have an "a tension" adjustment. Spring balancing is done with this adjustment, but in the opposite direction. That is, loosening the "a tension" has the same effect as tightening the "b tension."
