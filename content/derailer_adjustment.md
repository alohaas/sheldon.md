Derailer Adjustment

How Derailers Work
---
Most modern bicycles use [derailer](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_da-o.html#derailer) (or [d√©railleur](http://sheldonbrown.com/derailer.html), if you prefer the French spelling) gearing systems. Gear shifting is accomplished by leading the chain from one [sprocket](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_sp-ss.html#sprocket) to another.

Derailers look complicated, but they are actually very simple, brute-force devices.

The [front derailer](http://sheldonbrown.com/derailer-adjustment.html#front) simply consists of a [cage](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ca-g.html#cage) made of sheet metal that can move back and forth from side to side. As it does so, it pushes the chain sideways until it can't run on the [chainwheel](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ch.html#chainwheel) it has been riding on, then the chain falls off and lands on the chainwheel closest to its new location.

The [rear derailer](http://sheldonbrown.com/derailer-adjustment.html#rear) looks more complicated, but the only additional complication is that the rear derailer also contains the arm with the spring-loaded pulleys, that takes up the slack as the chain goes to smaller sprockets.

Both derailers work by pushing the chain sideways, so that it runs at an angle onto the sprocket, instead of straight. When the angle becomes sharp enough, the chain can no longer mesh with the sprocket. It then falls off of the sprocket and lands on the next one in line.

When the chain is being shifted from a smaller sprocket to a larger one, it is slightly different. The chain is forced to rub against the side of the larger sprocket next to the one it is riding on. Eventually, it gets snagged on the sides of the teeth of the larger sprocket, and yanked up and away.

Newer sprockets usually have specially shaped teeth, and ramps on their sides to make this operation run more smoothly. This is the major reason that modern derailer gear systems work better than older ones. It has very little to do with the quality of the derailer.

##Before You Try To Adjust A Rear Derailer, Make Sure It Isn't Bent!

Before you try to adjust your rear derailer, you should really make sure it isn't bent. The rear derailer is the most fragile and exposed part of a bicycle, and they are always getting bonked.

When a rear derailer gets whacked, it bends inward, toward the spokes. In some cases, it will actually go into the spokes of the rear wheel while it is turning. This is very bad news when it happens. If you are lucky, the derailer breaks. If you are less lucky, it takes a few spokes with it, and can easily ruin your rear wheel. If you are truly unfortunate, the pull of the spokes on the derailer can tug it backwards so forcefully that the [dropout](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_dr-z.html#dropout) (the frame part that the rear axle and derailer attach to) will be bent very sharply backward, or even broken. In some cases, this can render a frame a total loss.

When the derailer gets biffed, it is not usually the derailer itself that bends, but rather the hanger, the tab of the frame dropout that the derailer attaches to. This is because the part of the derailer that usually gets bumped is the strongest part, the [parallelogram](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_p.html#parallelogram) linkage that moves the [cage](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ca-g.html#cage) back and forth. (Note; on many older or less expensive bicycles, the hanger is not part of the frame, but is a separate part, which comes with the derailer.) This "[adaptor claw](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_aa-l.html#adaptor)" is held on mainly by the rear axle nut, or the quick-release skewer. On many newer frames, it is a bolt-on part, so it can be replaced if bent.

You can roughly check alignment by eye, if you look at the derailer from the rear. The two pulleys should be lined up **exactly** underneath one another, so that the chain runs straight up from the [tension pulley](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ta-o.html#tensionpulley) to the [jockey pulley](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_i-k.html#jockeypulley), with no sideways slant. Compare the line of the pulleys with that of the sprockets above them.

Well-intentioned folks sometimes grab ahold of the derailer and try to pull it back outward to its proper position. Unfortunately, they usually wind up yanking on the derailer by its [pulley cage](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ca-g.html#cage), which is the weakest part. As a result, they fail to straighten the bent hanger, and, instead, bend the cage as well.

When a derailer hanger is bent, it is generally necessary to remove the derailer to straighten it. Bike shops have a special tool, a bar with a sliding gauge on it, that screws into the hole in the hanger in place of the derailer. This tool provides lots of leverage to straighten the hanger with, and has a gauge to judge when it is parallel to the rear wheel. A rough, on-road repair is sometimes possible by removing the derailer and bending the tab with an adjustable wrench.

Note, wide-range [Campagnolo](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ca-g.html#campagnolo) derailers have cages that are **not** intended to be vertical; the lower pulley is farther outboard than the jockey pulley.

The Four Rear Derailer Adjustments, In Order of Importance

##The limit-stop screws
The limit stops are two screws that set the limits of how far the derailer can move from left to right. They are usually located on the back of the parallelogram; sometimes they face outward to the bicycle's right. The ends of a screw bumps into an internal part of the parallelogram when the derailer has moved all the way in the direction controlled by that screw.

The limit screws are not intended to move the derailer; they tell it where to stop when it is moved by the [shifter](http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_sa-o.html#shifter) control. Loosening a limit stop allows the derailer to be moved farther in a particular direction by the shifter. Tightening it restricts the motion of the derailer in that direction.

Normally, the limit stops need to be set when a new derailer is installed, and should not require any further attention. If they seem to need adjustment on a bicycle that used to work properly, it is usually an indication that the derailer is [bent](. Trying to correct a bent derailer with the adjusting screws is OK as a temporary field repair, but is not a correct long-term repair.

On newer derailers, the limit stop screws are labeled: "H" (high) and "L" (low). On some older derailers, there is no such label, because the working ends of the screws are visible. If you shift such a derailer into high gear, note which screw is bumping into an internal part of the derailer...that screw is the high-gear stop; the other is the low-gear stop.

These are not particularly fussy adjustments. Don't be afraid to give half a turn or a turn at a time. The only place where there's any danger is the rear derailer's low gear stop, which can allow the derailer to go into the spokes if it is set very loose. The other limit stop screw of the rear derailer (and the two on the front derailer) will cause overshifting if set too loose, but this is relatively harmless and easily corrected.
